# Missing some functionality working w/ localstorage
Able to add task, delete and mark as compelte. Working on a way to update compelete status to localstorage.<br />
Im using textcontent to add text to dom elements which i asume is preventing xss.

# Bugs
Filter not working. For some reason I cant access the classlist of an element.
Complete status not persisting on localStorage
